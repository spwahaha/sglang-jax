# Qwen2.5-VL on SGL-JAX

> **Validated recipe** — empirically validated on TPU v6e-4 with sglang-jax 0.1.0; §4 Benchmark is intentionally omitted (see §4 omitted note + design §3 Validated criteria interpretation).

## 1. Model Introduction

[**Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL**](https://huggingface.co/Qwen) is Alibaba's second-generation Qwen vision-language family — multimodal decoders that ingest images / video frames and emit text, with the same chat interface as text-only Qwen2.5. SGL-JAX serves it through the multimodal pipeline (`--multimodal`), which runs a separate ViT stage that produces vision embeddings and an autoregressive stage that does prefill/decode.

**Variants** (pick by size):

- [**Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct**](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct) — 3B parameters; candidate single-host path on v6e-4 with `--tp-size 1`.
- [**Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct**](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) — 7B; candidate single-host path on v6e-4 with `--tp-size 1`.
- [**Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct**](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) — 32B; starter single-host path on v6e-4 with `--tp-size 4`.
- [**Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct**](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) — 72B; multi-host serving is pending.

For the text-only Qwen3 dense recipes see [Qwen3 recipe](../../autoregressive/Qwen/Qwen3).

**Key Features**:

- **Multi-image and video input** — single chat request can mix any number of `image_url` and `video_url` content blocks alongside the text prompt; the OpenAI Vision API schema is used directly.
- **Long-context VL** — supports the underlying Qwen2.5 32K context window (extendable to 128K with rope scaling on supported checkpoints).
- **Instruction-tuned** — default chat behaviour; no per-request `enable_thinking` toggle (Qwen2.5 is non-reasoning; for reasoning use Qwen3).
- **Two-stage SGL-JAX pipeline** — Qwen2.5-VL runs as a `vit` scheduler stage producing vision embeddings + an `auto_regressive` stage doing prefill/decode; `--multimodal` enables both.

**Recommended Generation Parameters**: `temperature=0.7`, `top_p=0.95`, `max_tokens=1024` (verify defaults against each variant's model card).

## 2. Deployment

### 2.1 Hardware Matrix

| Model | TPU | Topology | `--tp-size` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-VL-32B | **v6e-4** | 2x2 | 4 | This is the slice we walked end-to-end. Single host; v6e is 1:1 chip↔device. For 3B / 7B variants, use the same v6e-4 host with `--tp-size 1` and the launch shape in §2.3. The 72B variant needs a multi-host SGL-JAX staging path that isn't followable today. |

> Multimodal recipes are constrained by SGL-JAX's built-in staged runtime. Use the `--tp-size` shown for the model; a larger TPU slice is not automatically used by changing only `--tp-size`.

See [TPU topology reference](../../base/tpu-topology-reference) for the TPU generation reference. For other slices (larger v6e, v7x variants), see [Adapting to other topologies](../../base/tpu-topology-reference#adapting-to-other-topologies).

### 2.2 Environment

Install per [Install guide](../../get_started/install). For the current single-host VL paths use [Single-host Docker template](../../deployment/single-host-docker). Qwen2.5-VL 72B multi-host should stay pending until the built-in staging and scheduler path are fixed.

Extra pip for accuracy benchmarking only:

```bash
pip install evalscope==0.17.1
```

### 2.3 Launch

#### Single-host — TPU v6e-4

```bash
JAX_COMPILATION_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/jit_cache python -u -m sgl_jax.launch_server \
  --multimodal \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct \
  --trust-remote-code \
  --tp-size 4 \
  --device tpu \
  --dtype bfloat16 \
  --mem-fraction-static 0.8 \
  --chunked-prefill-size 2048 \
  --page-size 128 \
  --max-running-requests 32 \
  --skip-server-warmup \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 30000
```

For Qwen2.5-VL-3B or Qwen2.5-VL-7B, use the same command shape but set `--model-path` to the target checkpoint and `--tp-size 1`.

> `--multimodal` is required — without it, the launcher boots the text-only HTTP server which has no ViT stage and cannot consume `image_url` / `video_url` content blocks.

### 2.4 Configuration Tips

**Memory Management:**
- VL workloads use HBM for both KV cache **and** vision embeddings (ViT output). The 32B/72B variants run with lower `--mem-fraction-static` (0.8 / 0.9) than the equivalent text-only Qwen3 to leave room for vision tensors that scale with input image count.
- Lower `--max-running-requests` (64 for VL vs 256 for text-only Qwen3 at the same size) — each VL request can carry multiple high-resolution images that explode KV demand. Raise only if you measure HBM headroom.

**Built-in multimodal staging:**
- SGL-JAX internally splits Qwen2.5-VL into a vision stage and an autoregressive generation stage.
- The public launch knob is still `--tp-size`, but it must match the supported staging path for the selected model. Do not scale VL models by increasing only `--tp-size`.
- Current cookbook paths: 3B/7B candidates use `--tp-size 1`, 32B uses `--tp-size 4`, and 72B multi-host remains pending.

**Chunked Prefill (image embeddings):**
- `--chunked-prefill-size 2048` bounds peak HBM during prefill. Vision-language prefills include both text tokens and vision embeddings — raising this past 4096 risks prefill-time OOM on 32B/72B variants.

**Multimodal Attention Backend:**
- The vision-language attention path runs on the default `--attention-backend fa` (FlashAttention on Pallas) — no override needed.

**Remote media URLs:**
- `image_url` / `video_url` inputs must be fetchable **from the TPU host** — a URL that loads in your browser can still fail server-side on auth / region / firewall. Stage the media on a mounted volume and pass `file:///path/to/media`, or use a publicly reachable URL.

**Compilation Cache Hygiene:**
- `JAX_COMPILATION_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/jit_cache` is mandatory — without it, first request blocks ~4 min per stage while XLA/Pallas re-compiles every kernel (ViT and AR each compile independently).
- The cache keys on full kernel shape: changing `--page-size`, `--tp-size`, image resolution buckets, or `--context-length` invalidates cached entries.

For full flag definitions see [Launch flags reference](../../base/launch-flags-reference); run `python -m sgl_jax.launch_server --multimodal --help` to see multimodal-specific flags.

## 3. Invocation

### 3.1 Basic Chat Completion (text only)

Qwen2.5-VL accepts plain-text requests on the same OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint — useful for sanity-checking the server before sending images:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who are you?"}]
  }'
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1", api_key="EMPTY")

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who are you?"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 3.2 Multimodal Input

Vision-language input uses the OpenAI Vision API schema — each `messages[i].content` is a **list** of content blocks mixing `image_url`, `video_url`, and `text`. SGL-JAX accepts both `https://` URLs and local files via the `file://` protocol.

#### Single Image

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1", api_key="EMPTY")

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": {"url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"},
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image in one sentence."},
        ],
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct",
    messages=messages,
    max_tokens=256,
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Output Example:**

```text
A wooden boardwalk stretches through a vibrant green wetland under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds.
```

#### Multi-Image

Stack multiple `image_url` blocks into the same `content` list followed by a single text prompt:

```python
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/before.jpg"}},
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/after.jpg"}},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Compare these two images and describe what changed in 50 words or less."},
        ],
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct",
    messages=messages,
    max_tokens=256,
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Output Example:**

```text
The 'before' shot shows an empty workshop floor; the 'after' shot shows the same space populated with assembled chairs and a long workbench, suggesting the workspace was cleaned, organized, and turned into a production area.
```

#### Video

Use a `video_url` content block — same schema as `image_url`. The server samples frames from the video and feeds them through the ViT stage:

```python
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "video_url", "video_url": {"url": "https://example.com/clip.mp4"}},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe what happens in this video in 3 bullet points."},
        ],
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct",
    messages=messages,
    max_tokens=512,
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Output Example:**

```text
- A small group of seagulls gathers on a wet rocky beach at the water's edge.
- A wave rolls in and partially submerges the rocks, scattering the birds briefly.
- The birds return and resume foraging in the shallow tide as the wave recedes.
```

> **Long video / large image set:** Make sure `--context-length` is large enough to fit the vision token count plus the text prompt and response. Each high-resolution image and each sampled video frame contributes a non-trivial number of vision tokens to the prefill.

> Qwen2.5-VL is non-reasoning (no `<think>` blocks) and does not ship a native tool-call format. For reasoning workloads use [Qwen3](../../autoregressive/Qwen/Qwen3); for tool-calling workloads use a model with `--tool-call-parser` support (see [`Qwen3.md` §3.3](../../autoregressive/Qwen/Qwen3#3-3-tool-calling)).

## 4. Benchmark

> Benchmark section is intentionally omitted — Qwen2.5-VL is a Starter recipe (banner). All §4.1 Accuracy / §4.2 Speed cells are pending real PR-back measurements. When you run a numbered MMMU / MMMU Pro Vision / DocVQA / ChartQA eval against the model on TPU, file a PR adding the §4 block back with the actual numbers and upgrade the banner to Partially validated or Validated. For the canonical four-part §4 form (Test Environment / Deployment Command / Benchmark Command / Test Results) see any Validated recipe in [Autoregressive index](../../autoregressive).
>
> Note: `bench_serving` does not have native multimodal input support today, so §4.2 Speed needs a custom OpenAI-client load test driving the §3.2 multi-image / video patterns; PR back full TTFT / ITL / output tok/s along with the image resolution and prompt template used.
